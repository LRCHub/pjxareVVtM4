Until I got mad, hold on to me
Handle with care, beautiful love
The more I get stable the more I can feel
That you're in state of weariness.

Our love is waterproof
Our love needs protection
With just the sun above you'll say.
Such a sunny day.

Longing afternoons sucking honey spoons.
Dry, wet, sweet breast lapping till you shake.
Blind me with love, my hear is open.
Sunny days are faking, staring failure.

Our love is waterproof
Our love needs protection
With just the sun above you'll say.
Such a sunny day, feed me that I may sleep.
