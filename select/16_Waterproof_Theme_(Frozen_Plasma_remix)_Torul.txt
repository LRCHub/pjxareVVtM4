This time
Again
It seems so unreal
Your words of me
Is this how you feel?

Your waitin' list
Is not a dream
Why is impatience
Tearin' our scheme?

Linger-free
I'm outta here
Our finest hours will
Disappear

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, in my dream
That I will come to what is real

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real

This time
Again
It seems too unreal
Your words of me
As made for a film

Waitin' still
It's not a dream
Why is impatience
Tearin' our scheme?

Out of this, the point of being
The finest hours will re-appear

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real

Silence now, In our film
'cause our impatience's a Waterproof theme

I have a fear, In my dream
That I will come to what is real
