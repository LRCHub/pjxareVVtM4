And how enormously
The planets they have turned on thee
But they do it to us all
The Universe gets tough and small

So dubbin up your boots
Make sure you're waterproof
And fasten up your coat
The weather it brings change
The wind it brings us change and blows

And how predictable,
That it should tumble in this way
And we even saw it come
And getting closer every day

And then it lifted off the roof
No longer waterproof
The rain are tumbling in
Another storm begins
Another storm of love and truth

So dubbin up your boots
Make sure you're waterproof
And fasten up your coat
The weather it brings change
The wind it brings us change and blows
